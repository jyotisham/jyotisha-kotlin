# JyotiSha tools and data

## Intro
A package to do various panchaanga (traditional vedic astronomical / astrological) calculations, produce calendars.

For a survey of similar software, see [here](https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/astronomy/).

## For users
For detailed examples and help, please see individual module files - especially test files in this package.

## For contributors
Contributions welcome! Please see some basic comments (pertaining to the time format used internally, API layers required) in the base jyotisha package though.

### Testing and autotesting
Every push to this repository SHOULD pass tests. We should have a rich, functional set of tests at various levels. Saves everyone's time.

You can see the status of failing tests and builds at https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha-kotlin/actions . PS: You can probably subscribe to get email notification on failed workflow runs as well - I'm getting these.
